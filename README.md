# Hi 👋

I am a nerd, and I love cybersec.
I primarily code in **C/C++**, but I also know Python, HTML, CSS, JS and a bit of Kotlin. I am also learning AutoHotkey, Java and Dart too.

Some other names you might've seen me online:
- solidwild
- solidw
- VadSzil43
- 0x42

* 📚 In elementary school
* 💻 Hobbyist developer and reverser
* 🎮 Making Minecraft clients
* 🍿 Widevine tinkerer
* 💬 Creator of Vibe+ (wip, private)
* 🗝️ Hates DRM and obfuscation
* 😡 Most annoying guy of all time

Anyways, that's it. I am not active on GitHub (I don't check the GitHub website, but I code A LOT in my private repos), so if you want to contact me, please click **[here](https://solidwild.yrs.lol)** instead.

(i love markdown)
