# Hi 👋

I am a nerd, and I love cybersec. I also like giving others Minecraft content (Patrix, Continuum etc, if you are interested DM me on Discord) <br />
I primarily code in **C/C++**, but I also know Python, HTML, CSS, JS and a bit of Kotlin. I am also learning AutoHotkey, Java, Rust and Dart too.

Some other names you might've seen me online:
- solidwild
- solidw
- VadSzil43
- 0x42

* 📚 In elementary school (yes)
* 💻 Hobbyist developer and reverser
* 🎮 Giving our paid MC shit for free
* 🍿 Widevine tinkerer
* 🗝️ Hates DRM
* 🖕 Fuck Microsoft
* 😡 Most annoying guy of all time

Anyways, that's it. I am not active on GitHub (I don't check the GitHub website, but I code A LOT in my private repos), so if you want to contact me, please DM me on Discord or Reddit (**[here](https://solidwild.yrs.lol)**).

(i love markdown)
